# 🐉 D&D API Explorer

A React + Vite project that pulls selected information from the [Dungeons & Dragons 5e API](https://www.dnd5eapi.co/) and presents it in a clean, browsable interface.  
It was pair-programmed as part of my **Northcoders Bootcamp** journey to strengthen skills in React, API integration and project structure.
